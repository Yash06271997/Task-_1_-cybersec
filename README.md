## Task Title
Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

## Description
This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the Cyber Security Internship.
The task focuses on understanding fundamental cyber security concepts such as the
CIA Triad, types of cyber attackers, attack surfaces, OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities,
and application data flow.
